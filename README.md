# ü§ñ AI Development Assistant

### CLAUDE.md File
This project includes a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file designed to guide AI development assistants (specifically Claude Code from Anthropic) when working with the codebase.

**What it does:**
- **Project Context**: Provides complete understanding of the WordPress project structure
- **Coding Standards**: Defines PHP, TypeScript, and SCSS development standards
- **Architecture Guide**: Explains monorepo structure and component organization
- **Command Reference**: Lists all available development commands
- **Best Practices**: Outlines security, performance, and WordPress-specific guidelines
- **Code Examples**: Includes practical examples for common development tasks

**Why it's useful:**
- Ensures consistent code quality when working with AI assistants
- Reduces onboarding time for new developers
- Maintains project-specific standards and conventions
- Provides quick reference for complex development workflows

The file serves as a "developer handbook" that enables AI tools to understand the project's unique architecture, coding standards, and development practices, resulting in more accurate and contextually appropriate code suggestions and implementations.
